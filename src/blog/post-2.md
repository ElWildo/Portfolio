Today and Sunday a did a bit of cleanup
I fixed the menu in a way that was functional and nice to see both on mobile and desktop.
Same thing for the toggle on dark and light theme (I still need to fic the palette for those tho, lol)

Interestingly I manage to update both the Hamburger Icon and Theme Icon to React components.
I had to mess around a bit to sync animation properly for what I wanted but I'm satisfied with the results.
Since I just mentioned them I added animation for page routing and menu appearing and disappearing.
I'm not entirely sure I should implement animation for the style itself, cause it seems to me an overkill, but we'll see.

I added support for SASS. Used it for the new react components, but still need to implement it for tutorial pages.
It's not extremely urgent so I'll put it on hold for now.

I also setup a Board on github (their project management tool is amazing to keep track of the things you are doing on your projects) for this website/portfolio to keep track of things. Already added task to design header, footer and fix the palettes. I will probably add some more to think about somecool design, cause as the website is right it's a bit MEH. Oh. I should probably also add one for the fonts.

Not a big update but I haven't done much on the website to be fair and refactoring/updating the functionality required to invest a bit of time in learning bits and bobs so I think it's fair.

Have a good one!
