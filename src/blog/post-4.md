I'm reaching the end of the posts I will write about this website, at least for now.
I just got back from the Christmas holiday and decided to finish the blog itself and start creating content to add to it this week. So, I added what was missing.

The blog posts' list now has a proper UI. It may not be exceptional, but at least it's functional. The changes have been quick as well. Astro's tutorial guides you to set up the blog list as a function, iterating through all the blog posts and returning an HTML element to be rendered, so it was relatively easy to customize. The most complicated part was rendering each post as a single "glass panel" without overlapping the container. For that, I had to write a new page template, but the structure was still pretty close to the base one.

Finally, I added a new favicon and default images. As you can see, they are the same, but they do their job, and I don't dislike them for how the website looks right now.

The website still needs some visual improvement on the landing page and proper listing on Google with a sitemap and robots.txt files. I may write a post about them down the line if they result in any interest while working on them.

Have a good one!
